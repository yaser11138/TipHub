# TipHub
TipHub is a community-driven open-source project that aims to provide a platform for programmers and admins to share tips about programming languages and soft skills. Users can browse through the tips, leave comments, and like them. The project is built using the Django framework and incorporates features such as user authentication and authorization, a dashboard for admins to manage tips, and a search bar for easy navigation. 

TipHub is an excellent resource for programmers of all levels to learn new skills, stay up-to-date with the latest trends, and connect with like-minded individuals. The platform fosters a collaborative and supportive environment where users can share their knowledge and help others grow.
